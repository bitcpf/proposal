% Challenge in wireless communication
Due to the convenience of deployment and utility, wireless devices and network
has become the dominant tools for telecommunication. However, the spectrum resource
is limited in natural and has to be approved for accessibility, there is a huge challenge 
for individual devices and infrastructure to efficiently exploit the licensed 
frequency. 
In 2009, the FCC has approved the use of broadband services in the white space 
of UHF TV bands, which were formerly exclusively licensed to television broadcasters.
These white space bands are now available for unlicensed public use, offerring
new opportunities for new design of device and network with better performance in 
throughput and economy cost. In this work, we investigate multiband adaptation
in both link communication and network deployment. Furthermore, we design algorithms
with in-field measurement to improve the link and network performance.

First, 
%since wireless propagation largely depends on the environment
%in operation, a historical understanding of the frequency bands' performance in
%a given environment could expedite band selection as vehicles transition across
%diverse scenarios. 
we leverage knowledge of in-situ operation
across frequency bands with real-time measurements of the activity level to 
select the the band with the highest throughput. To do so, we
perform a number of experiments in typical vehicular topologies. With two
models based on machine learning algorithms and an in-situ training set, we 
predict the throughput based on: ({\it i.}) prior performance for similar
context information ({\it e.g.}, SNR, GPS, relative speed, and link distance),
and ({\it ii.}) real-time activity level and relative channel quality per band.
In the field, we show that training on a repeatable route with these machine
learning techniques can yield vast performance improvements from prior schemes.

Second, 
%while many metropolitan areas sought to deploy city-wide WiFi networks, the densest urban areas were not
%able to broadly leverage the technology for large-scale Internet access.  Ultimately, the small 
%spatial separation required for effective 802.11 links in these areas resulted in prohibitively large up-front 
%costs.  
%the far greater range of these lower white space carrier frequencies are especially critical in rural areas, where
%high levels of aggregation could dramatically lower the cost of deployment and is in direct contrast 
%to dense urban areas in which networks are built to maximize spatial reuse.  Thus, leveraging a broad 
%range of spectrum across diverse population densities becomes a critical issue for the deployment of data
%networks with WiFi and white space bands. 
we measure the spectrum utility in the Dallas-Fort 
Worth metropolitan and surrounding
areas and propose a measurement-driven band selection framework, Multiband Access Point Estimation (MAPE). 
In particular, we study the white space and WiFi bands with in-field spectrum utility measurements, revealing 
the number of access points required for an area with channels in multiple bands. In doing so, we find that 
networks with white space bands reduce the number of access points by up to 1650\% in sparse
rural areas over similar WiFi-only solutions. In more populated rural areas and sparse urban areas, we 
find an access point reduction of 660\% and 412\%, respectively.  However, due to the heavy use of white
space bands in dense urban areas, the cost reductions invert (an increase in required access points 
of 6\%).  Finally, we numerically analyze band combinations in typical rural and urban areas and show 
the critical factor that leads to cost reduction: considering the same total number of channels, as more 
channels are available in the white space bands, less access points are required for a given area.

Furthermore, we model the heterogeneous white space and WiFi access tier 
deployment problem. We propose a relaxed ILP to get the lower bound of the 
amount of access point under resource limitations and a heuristic approach 
of the problem. We start from the uniform population distribution wireless 
network deployment, then discuss the non-uniform population distribution 
wireless network deployment. Then, we discuss white space band application
in multiple spectrum resource degree. 
In particular, we map the problem as a Bin packing problem 
and resolve it with Multiband Hetegeneous Access Point deployment method. 
In doing so, we discuss the benefit of white space bands in reducing 
the number of acess points and provide heuristic solution for access point
 selection. Our numerical simulation shows that
hetergeneous access point could benefit most of the scenarios in wireless
access tier deployment.

Forth,
%we consider
%how white space bands can be leveraged in large-scale backhual
%wireless mesh network deployments. In particular, 
we present
an integer linear programming model to leverage diverse prop-
agation characteristics of white space and WiFi bands to deploy
optimal WhiteMesh networks. Since such optimization is known
to be NP-hard, we design a heuristic algorithm, Band-based Path
Selection (BPS), which we show approaches the performance of
the optimal solution with reduced complexity. We additionally
compare the performance of BPS against two well-known multi-
channel, multi-radio deployment algorithms across a range of
scenarios spanning those typical for rural areas to urban areas.
In doing so, we achieve between 3 to 6 times the gateway goodput
of these existing multi-channel, multi-radio algorithms, which
are agnostic to diverse propagation characteristics across bands.
Moreover, we show that, with similar channel resources and
bandwidth, the joint use of WiFi and white space bands can
achieve a served user demand of 170\% that of mesh networks
with only WiFi bands or white space bands, respectively.
% Future work
Lastly, we propose to discuss the beamforming application in 
large scale network deployment. Beamforming is a efficient way to 
increase the spatial reuse. With the application of beaforming,
a single access point could communicate with multiple device 
simultaneously. In large scale network deployment, beamforming
could increase the capacity of an access point and lower the cost 
through reducing the number of access points. In our work, we
will investigate in what degree the beamforming could benifet
the vendors in wireless network deployment.
