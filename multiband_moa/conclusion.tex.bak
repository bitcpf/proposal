\section{Summary}
\label{sec:moaconclusion}

In this work, we jointly considered the use of WiFi and white space bands for 
a single access point in wireless network deployment. To compare the network
deployment costs in multiple scenarios, we proposed a Multiband Hetergeneous AP
Deployment framework to find the number of access points required in a given region.
We then performed numerical simulation to evaluate the gains of white space channels
in access point deployment. Through extensive analysis across varying population 
density and channel combinations across bands, we show that white space bands 
can reduce the number of access points by 260\% in sufficient white space configuration
and 80\% gain in limited white channel scenarios.
