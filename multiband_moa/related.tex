% White Space large propagation range
With new FCC regulations on the use of white space bands, there are two factors to
consider with such bands: large propagation range and existing inter-network interference from 
TV stations and other devices such as microphones~\cite{fccwhitespace,cui2013leveraging,bahl2009white}.
Prior work does not specifically study the benefits of jointly using white space and WiFi bands in
deployment of wireless access networks~\cite{akyildiz2005wireless}. Additionally, prior work related
to white spaces target opportunistic media access. However, the application of white spaces 
across diverse population densities has not been fully explored.
%outdoor environment, such as urban and rural areas, has not been exploited. Lacking the 
%discussion of white space in outdoor environment is blocking the development of white space
%applications.
 
 % Network propagation difference
Finally, some works discuss the propagation variation in both WiFi bands and white space bands.
For example, Robinson et al. models the propagation variation at the same band in terrain 
domain~\cite{robinson2010deploying}. Another work proposes a databased-driven framework for
designing a white space network with database of primary user (TV station) locations and channel 
occupation~\cite{murty2012senseless}. However, these works do not jointly study
the influence of white space and WiFi bands on network deployment according to their resulting 
propagation variation and spectrum utilization.
